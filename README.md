# FTP-Managerx
This project is building the swing application that is used to maintain files on the web host.
A File Transfer Protocol client (FTP client) is a software utility that establishes a connection between a host computer and a remote server, typically an FTP server. An FTP client provides the dual-direction transfer of data and files between two computers over a TCP network or an Internet connection.
